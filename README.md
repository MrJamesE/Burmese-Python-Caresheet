# Burmese Python Caresheet
This website is my first development project as I learn HTML and CSS. It is an educational site presenting information from my own experience and knowledge of pythons and other snakes. The information is presented with a retro arcade/classic game aesthetic, including a "cheat sheet" section compiling key information into short notes reminiscent of video game combo-move lists that I would find when I was young. I'm a life long reptile (and other animal) enthusiast who has always loved gaming and computers as well, so I'm currently using this page to build skills and enjoy my new passion while also incorporating what I've always loved! I will continue to improve the website as I learn.

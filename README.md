# Burmese Python Caresheet
This website is my first development project as I learn HTML and CSS. It is an educational site presenting information from my own experience and knowledge of Burmese pythons and other snakes. The content is presented with a retro arcade/classic game aesthetic, including a "cheat sheet" section compiling key information into short notes reminiscent of video game combo-move guides that I would find when I was young. The background image is a photograph of mine which I pixelated and further edited. I'm a life long reptile (and other animal) enthusiast who has always loved gaming and computers as well, so I'm currently using this page to build skills and enjoy my new passion while also incorporating what I've always loved! I will continue to improve the website as I learn.

          <section><h3>Heating</h3>
            <h4 class="temp">+/- 90deg, +/- 80deg</h4>
            <p>Maintain a warm side and a cool side, so that your scalepuppy can thermoregulate and always find a comfortable spot.

          <h3>Feeding</h3>
          <h4>f/t: width=snake-width</h4>
          <p>Food should pre-killed whenever possible, and be roughly the size of the thickest part of your snakes body. As babies they can be fed once every 7-10 days, but it's important to not overfeed as they mature. An over-fed Burmese python will grow too quickly and become obese, which causes health problems and shortens their life span. It's okay to let a couple weeks go by between meals sometimes if your pet is getting too chunky! This way their body is not in a constant state of digestion.</p>

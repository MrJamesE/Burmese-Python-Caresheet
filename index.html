          <section class="heat"><h3 id="hot">Heating</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">Maintain a warm side (around 90&#176;F) and a cool side (around 80&#176;F), so that your pet can thermoregulate and 
              always find a comfortable spot. For a young snake (or any which uses hides) make sure 
              there are hides on both sides.

          <section class="feeding">
            <h3 id="mealtime">Food and Water</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">Food should be pre-killed whenever possible, and be roughly the size of the thickest part 
              of your snakes body. As babies they can be fed once every 7-10 days, but it's important 
              to not overfeed as they mature. An over-fed Burmese python will grow too quickly and 
              become obese, which causes health problems and shortens their life span. When feeding adults, it's okay to 
              let a couple weeks go by between meals sometimes if your pet is getting too chunky! This 
              way their body is not in a constant state of digestion.

              It's ideal to provide fresh purified water for your snake to drink and if possible soak in as desired.
              Water usually needs to be changed at least once a week.</p>

          <section class="housing">
            <h3 id="home">Housing</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">Provide a large enough enclosure for your snake to be able to fully stretch out if 
              possible, or at least to be no longer than the width plus one end of their enclosure. 
              An adult Burmese python could potentially require 8' x 4' or larger. Keep in mind also 
              that females grow larger and heavier than males! Be sure to do a thorough cleaning at least
              once a month, while spot cleaning as needed.

          </section>
          <section class="humidity"> 
            <h3 id="humid">Humidity</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">65-70% humidy is usually good, although I sometimes raise humidity while a snake 
              is in shed. Burmese pythons are prone to respiratory illness and need good humidity 
              but also clean air.
          </section>
          <section class="shedding">
           <h3 id="shed">Shedding</h3>
           <p class="paragraphs">Maintaining correct humidity usually helps shedding go smoothly. Having enough water 
            for the snake to soak in is also helpful, and they often enjoy water! 
            If any shed does get stuck, I've had success with giving a warm bath for 30 minutes 
            or less.

           <section class="handling">
            <h3 id="handle">Handling and Safety</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">Burmese pythons are usually awesome snakes to handle. Their huge size and laid back
              attitudes make them incredible reptile ambassadors! As is the case with many snakes, 
              if you support their weight and are gentle with them they will be gentle with you. 
              Mine is often happy to just lay on my lap. Babies and youngsters can be defensive, 
              but gentle and consistent time with them will be rewarded. That being said, large 
              constrictors are incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous in the wrong circumstances. 
              Get to know your individual very well. Recognize any changes in their behavior. When 
              you are educated and attentive, surprises are much less likely to happen! When opening your 
              pythons enclosure, always assume that it is hungry and hoping you bring food. Watch for jerky, 
              and possibly faster than usual movements that seem intensely focused. It is always a good idea 
              to tap your snake or move it gentley with a snake hook or similar item to let him or her know 
              that this isn't feeding time! <p class="paragraphs"> If you are mistaken for food, your snake may strike and latch on 
              tight while looping coils around whatever part of you it can. Rather than releasing you and 
              realizing it's mistake, your snake may seem "stuck" biting into you and squeezing, as if it 
              doesn't know how to stop. If you have a large adult, you should never be feeding or handling it 
              alone. If you do end up in this position, do <strong>not</strong> fight the snake or try to pry 
              it's mouth off of you. Instead, you have a few tried and true options to minimize harm to you or 
              your confused pet! You or your handling partner can pour mouthwash or hand sanitizer on the mouth 
              of the snake to snap them out of feeding mode. To quickly stop constriction, you can 
              nibble or pinch the end of the snakes tail! 
              </p>

            <section class="owning">
              <h3 id="toomuch">Too Much Pet?</h3>
              <p class="paragraphs">With females capable of exceeding 15 feet in length, Burmese pythons are among the
                largest snakes in the world. They are often also one of the most gentle. Defensive behaviors in snakes
                come from fear, and a snake the size of a tree trunk often has less of that! These are great pets
                for a responsible and capable adult or family. They should of course never be left alone with children, other pets,
                or anything that they could accidentally harm or which could harm them. They are incredibly powerful.
                If you have the resources and just as importantly the education, they are fantastic pets and reptile ambassadors!

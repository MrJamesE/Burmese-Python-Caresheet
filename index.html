        <h2>More Information:</h2>
        <section class="heat"><h3 id="hot">Heating</h3>
          <p>Maintain a warm side and a cool side, so that your scalepuppy can thermoregulate and always find a comfortable spot. For a young snake (or any which uses hides) make sure there are hides on both sides.

        <section class="feeding">
          <h3 id="meals">Feeding</h3>
          <p>Food should pre-killed whenever possible, and be roughly the size of the thickest part of your snakes body. As babies they can be fed once every 7-10 days, but it's important to not overfeed as they mature. An over-fed Burmese python will grow too quickly and become obese, which causes health problems and shortens their life span. It's okay to let a couple weeks go by between meals sometimes if your pet is getting too chunky! This way their body is not in a constant state of digestion.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="housing">
          <h3>Housing</h3>
          <p>Provide a large enough enclosure for your snake to be able to fully stretch out if possible, or at least to be no longer than the width plus one end of their enclosure. An adult Burmese python could potentially require 8' x 4' or larger. Keep in mind also that females grow larger and heavier than males!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="humidity"> 
          <h3 id="humid">Humidity</h3>
          <p>65-70% humidy is usually good, although I sometimes raise humidity while a snake is in shed. Burmese pythons are prone to respiratory illness and need good humidity but also clean air.
        </section>
        <section class="shedding">
         <h3>Shedding</h3>
         <p>Maintaining correct humidity usually helps shedding go smoothly. Having enough water for the snake to soak in is also helpful. If anything gets stuck, I've had success with giving a warm bath for 30 minutes or less.</p>
